loc[] — Label-based indexing
Accesses rows/columns using labels (names).

Syntax: df.loc[row_label, column_label]

✅ Examples:

df.loc[2]                  # Row with index label 2
df.loc[2, 'Player']        # Value at row with label 2 and column 'Player'
df.loc[2:5, ['Team', 'Runs']]  # Rows from label 2 to 5, specific columns
⚠️ Note: The range is inclusive of both ends (2 to 5).

🔹 iloc[] — Integer-location-based indexing
Accesses rows/columns by position (like using indexes in a list).

Syntax: df.iloc[row_index, column_index]

✅ Examples:

df.iloc[2]                  # 3rd row (0-based index)
df.iloc[2, 1]               # Value at 3rd row and 2nd column
df.iloc[2:5, 0:2]           # Rows 2 to 4 (5 not included), columns 0 and 1
⚠️ Note: The range is exclusive at the end (like in Python lists).
